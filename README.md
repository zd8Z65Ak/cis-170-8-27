Slope Formula App (vanilla JS)

This is a small frontend app that generates a random line (y = m x + b) and a coordinate (x, y). The user picks whether the coordinate lies on the line using an expanding menu. The line and point are drawn on a canvas.

To run locally:

```bash
# from repository root
python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory .
# then open http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html in your browser
```

Files:
- `index.html` — UI
- `app.js` — application logic and graphing
- `styles.css` — minimal styling

Feel free to ask for features (difficulty levels, scoring, answer reveal, exporting problems, etc.).
